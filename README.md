# TabbyCat

A Chrome extension to show tab characters

## Add to Chrome
First get the [Developer version of Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?extra=devchannel).
Go to chrome://extensions and 'Load Unpacked' with the folder you git cloned the source code into.

After improvements, I might look into putting it on the Chrome Web Store.
