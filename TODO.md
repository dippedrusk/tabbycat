# Laundry list

* Clicking the extension toggles TabbyCat functionality across all tabs
* When the extension is "on," new tabs and pages that are newly navigated to should still have showTabs applied
* Decide how to alternatively render tab characters
* How to deal with characters that are rendered that way before the extension was applied?
* Add try/catch blocks to deal with runtime errors
